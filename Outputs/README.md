# Outputs Information
There are two .csv files of criminal case output data generated by the ``Incident_Geometries.R`` and ``Rebooking_Incidents.R`` scripts, but the actual files themselves are private, and as such they will not be attached in this repository. A brief description of the two files is below.

``combined_data.csv``: Dataframe of criminal case incident numbers organized by location
``rebooking_incidents.csv``: Final dataframe of criminal case data and location information
